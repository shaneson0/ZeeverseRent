To Zeeverse Community and Zeeverse Team,

During my free time after work, I have been thinking a lot about how to help release liquidity for NFTs in Zeeverse.

As the game grows increasingly popular and the prices of legendary equipment skyrocket, a new problem arises here：

Users cannot afford to purchase a legendary Zee/Equipment, but they can afford the cost of short-term rentals, such as for 1 or 2 days; While the holders are also unwilling to sell.

I have come up with the idea of creating a rental contract service for Zeeverse, called ZeeverseRent, to address the lending issue that typically requires over-collateralization~

BTW,
No VC or IDO or ... ,
No token list,
No liquidity pool,
Just a tool,
Just for the community ~~

The contract will be open source in several days~

I have invited my friends who are some of the best auditors in the world, and a talent front-end engineer~

let us co-build the $VEE ～～～

Sincerely,
